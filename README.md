# Introduction
## What is <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a>

<a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/">Hacktoberfest</a> encourages participation in giving back to the open-source community by completing pull requests, participating in events, and donating to open-source projects. In its 11th year, Hacktoberfest continues to grow and foster a vibrant open-source community that we are all a part of.

## How Does It Work?

- Register anytime between September 23 and October 31.
- To qualify for digital swags, you must register and make four pull requests between October 1-31.
- You can contribute to any public repository on GitHub, not just the ones highlighted.
- If a maintainer reports your pull request as spam or behavior not in line with the projectâ€™s code of conduct, you will be ineligible to participate.

## <a href="https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#contributors">Rules of Hacktoberfest</a>

To earn your reward, you must register and make four valid pull requests (PRs) between October 1-31 in any time zone. Pull requests can be made in any participating GitHub-hosted repositories/projects.

# Repository Introduction

This repository is dedicated to providing coding answers for LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks. We invite you to contribute your solutions to various coding problems, enhancing the community's resources , and helping the new learners.

## How to Contribute

Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file for the format and guidelines on how to submit your pull requests. Your contributions should follow the specified format to ensure consistency and clarity.

### Pull Request Acceptance Policy

- I will only accept pull requests until **9 PM IST** each day. After that, I will update the repository myself.
- Contributions will be reviewed on a **first-come, first-served** basis. However, if someone submits a better solution with improved complexity, it may be prioritized.

## Congratulations!

Congratulations! You just made your first pull request, and if it gets merged, you can view it on the Hacktoberfest website.

I will merge all pull requests as quickly as possible, as long as they meet the project's requirements and guidelines and are legitimate.
